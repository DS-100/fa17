Updated grading policy coming soon!

There will be 2 challenging projects and 6 homework assignments.  Assignments
must be completed individually and will mix programming and short answer
questions.  At the end of each week of instruction, we will have an online
multiple choice quiz (vitamin) that will help you stay up-to-date with lecture
materials. Labs assignments will be graded for completion and are intended to
help with the projects.

* 24% Homeworks (6 assignments, 4% each)
* 16% Projects (2 projects, 8% each)
* 5% Vitamins
* 10% Labs
* 5% Participation
* 15% Midterm
* 25% Final

Participation is based on answering questions with clickers in lecture.  Full
credit is given for answering question in 18 lectures, and is pro-rated for
fewer than 18 lectures, i.e., min(number of lectures with recorded click,
18)/18.

### On Time Policy (try not to be late)

Each student gets an extension budget of 5 slip days. You can use the extension
on homework and project assignments during the semester. Do not plan to use
your slip-time; it is there for unforeseen circumstances!

After you have used up your slip-time budget, any assignment handed in late
will be marked off 20% per day late, rounded up to the nearest integer number
of days. No assignment will be accepted more then 5 days late.

### Collaboration Policy (don't cheat)

Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about
the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually. If you do
discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of
your solution. Keep in mind that content from the homework and vitamins will
likely be covered on both the midterm and final. We will be following the [EECS
departmental policy on Academic
Honesty](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/policies#dishonesty), so
be sure you are familiar with it.
