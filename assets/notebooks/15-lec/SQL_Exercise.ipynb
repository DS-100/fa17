For a table with $n$ rows and a sampling probability $p$, the output size comes from a [binomial distribution]() with mean $np$ and variance ($np(1-p)$). For a very small $p$, the variance means we could easily get 0 rows back when trying our query!\n",
    "1. If we don't know the size of the table, **it's hard to choose a practical sampling probability**. First we want to count up the number of rows $n$ (see the discussion of aggregation queries below), to inform us of a good $p$ to choose to get our desired output size. That means yet another full pass of the table to compute the count before we compute the sample!\n",
