  topic: Course Overview and The Data Science Life Cycle
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    In this lecture we provide an overview of the class, discuss what it means
    to be a data scientist by examining recent surveys of data scientists, and
    then introduce the data science lifecycle spanning question formation, data
    acquisition and cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualization, and
    finally prediction and inference.

  topic: Data Generation
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    Fundamentally, (data) science is the study of using data to learn about the
    world and solve problems.  However, how and what data is collected can have
    a profound impact on what we can learn and the problems we can solve. In
    this lecture, we will begin to explore various mechanisms for data
    collection and their implications on our ability to generalize.  In
    particular we will discuss differences between census, surveys, controlled
    experiments, and observational studies.  We will highlight the power of
    simple randomization and the fallacies of data scale.

  topic: Data Tables, Indexes, and Pandas
  lecturer: Lau
  description: |
    While data comes in many forms, most data analysis are done on tabular data.
    Mastering the skills of constructing, cleaning, joining, aggregating, and
    manipulating tabular data is essential to data science. In this lecture,
    we will introduce Pandas, the open-source Python data manipulation
    library widely used by data scientists. In addition to introducing new
    syntax, we will introduce new concepts including indexes, the role of
    column operations on system performance, and basic tools to begin
    visualizing data.

  topic: EDA and Data Cleaning
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    Whether collected by you or obtained from someone else, raw data is seldom
    ready for immediate analysis.  Through exploratory data analysis we can
    often discover important anomalies, identify limitations in the
    collection process, and better inform subsequent goal oriented analysis.
    In this lecture we will discuss how to identify and correct common data
    anomalies and their implications on future analysis.  We will also
    discuss key properties of data including structure, granularity,
    faithfulness, temporality and scope and how these properties can inform
    how we prepare, analyze, and visualize data.

  topic: Visualization and Data Tranformations
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    A large fraction of the human brain is devoted to visual perception.   As a
    consequence, visualization is a critical tool in both exploratory data
    analysis and communicating complex relationships in data.  However, making
    informative and clear visualizations of complex concepts can be
    challenging.  In this lecture, we explore good and bad visualizations
    and describe how to choose visualizations for various kinds of data and
    goals.

  topic: Visualization, Ctd.
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    Directly visualizing data can result in less informative for several reaasons:
    plots as curvilinear relationships can be difficult to assess;
    large numbers of observations can hide core features;
    and it can be difficult to visualize large  numbers of variables.
    In this lecture, we discuss techniques of data transformations, smoothing, and
    dimensionality reduction to address challenges in creating informative
    visualization. With these  additional analytics we can often reveal
    important and informative patterns in data.
    We pick up with transformations.

  topic: Working with text
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    Whether in documents, tweets, or records in a table, text data is
    ubiquitous and presents a unique set of challenges for data scientists.
    How do you extract key phrases from text?  What are meaningful aggregate
    summaries of text?  How do you visualize textual data?  In this lecture we
    will introduce a set of techniques (e.g., bag-of-words) to transform text
    into numerical data and subsequent tabular analysis.  We will also
    introduce regular expressions as a mechanism for cleaning and transforming
    text data data.

  topic: Modeling and Estimation
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    How do we pick a number to represent a dataset? What makes a number a good representation? The statistician (and data scientist ahead of his time) George Box once wrote “Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.” A key step in data science is developing models that capture the essential signal in data while providing insight into the phenomena that govern the data and enable prediction effective prediction.  In this lecture we address the fundamental question of how to choose a number and more generally a model that reflects the data.  We will introduce the concept of loss functions and begin to develop basic models.

  topic: Modeling and Estimation Continued
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    In this lecture we will continue our development of models within the framework of loss minimization.  In the process we will begin to study how loss minimization on the data relates to a broader goal of loss minimization on future predictions.  In the process we will review basic concepts in probability (distributions and expectations) and then introduce the concept of empirical risk minimization.

  topic: Probability theory, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Bootstraping
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
   We saw in the last lecture that we can study parameter estimators using theoretical 
   and computational approaches. In this lecture, we will delve deeper into the bootstrap
   to study the behvaior of the empirical 75th percentile as an estimator for
   its population counterpart.  We will derive the empirical quantile through optimization
   of a loss function, show that the population parameter minimizes the expected loss,
   bootstrap the sampling distribution of the empirical 75th percentile, and 
   use the bootstrapped distribution to provide interval estimates 
   for the population parameter. 
   In addition, we will provide a more comprehensive review of basic probability.

  topic: Hypothesis Testing 
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    A key step in inference is often answering a question about the world. We will
      consider 4 such questions to varying degrees of detail:  
      1) Is there enough evidence to bring someone to trial?
      2) Is there evidence of an earth-like planet orbiting a star? 
      3) Do female TAs get lower teaching evaluations than male TAs? 
      We use hypothesis testing to answer these questions.  
      In particular, we examine a
      collection non-parametric hypothesis tests.  These powerful procedures
      build on the basic idea of random simulation to help quantify the rarity
      of a particular phenomenon.  In the process of using these procedures we
      will also touch on the challenges of false discovery and multiple
      testing.

  topic: Big Data Part 1
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    Data management at the level of big organizations can be confusing and often relies on many different technologies. 
    In this lecture we will provide an overview of organizational data management and introduce some of the key technologies 
    used to store and compute on data at scale. Time permitting we will dive into some basic Spark programming.

  topic: P-Hacking
  lecturer: Guest Lecturer Aaditya Ramdas 
  description: |
    Almost daily, internet companies make decisions to change and update their website or app. As  simple examples, Google may run tests to see if users prefer their ads on the top or on the side of the page, where the Facebook like button should be placed or what it’s size should be, whether the default setting when you open the Uber/Lyft app should be “Pool” or “Solo” or “Luxury”, and so on. 

      After running "A/B" tests at some prescribed level of confidence, companies sometimes make decisions to alter their current website or app, in the hope of more money or clicks.  What proportion of these decisions (to change some feature, based on an A/B test) are “mistakes"? What might cause these mistakes in the first place? Is it even possible to track the number or fraction of bad decisions? We will gently introduce ideas in sequential testing, false discovery rate, and discuss why some of the answers can be quite subtle.

  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    How do we fit linear models to non-linear and often categorical data?  
    In this lecture we will continue our discussion of least squares linear regression. 
    We will revist the normal equations from the perspective of optimization and discuss some
    of the computational issues around solving the normal equations.  We will then transition
    to the task of feature engineering and describe a range of techniques for transforming data 
    to enable linear models to fit complex relationships.

  topic: Over fitting, Cross-validation, and Data Science Life Cycle
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    In this lecture we will follow the data science life cycle as we address a problem through fitting a linear model. Along the way, we touch on the following topics: how to select a loss function; the test-train split to avoid over fitting; selecting a Box-Cox transformation;  
    best subset regression; coding, collapsing, and fitting dummy variables; cross-validation
    for model selection.  In later lecture, we will continue the topic of model selection and
    address issues that arise when there are a large number of variables in the model.

  topic: The Bias Variance Tradeoff and Regularization
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    There is a fundamental tension in predictive modeling between our ability to fit the data and to generalize to the world. In this lecture we characterize this tension through the tradeoff between bias and variance.  We will derive the bias and variance decomposition of the least squares objective.  We then discuss how to manage this tradeoff by augmenting our objective with a regularization penalty.

  topic: Classification and Logistic Regression 
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: We consider the case where our response is categorical, in particular, we focus on the simple case where the response has two categories. We begin by using least squares to fit the binary response to categorical explanatory variables and find that the predictions are proportions. Next, we consider more complex model that is linear in quantitative explanatory variables, which is called the linear probability model, and we uncover limitations of this model. We motivate an alternative model, the logistic, by examining a local linear fit and matching its shape. We also draw connections between the logistic and log odds. Lastly, we introduce an alternative loss function that is more appropriate for working with probabilities, the Kullback-Leibler Divergence. We derive a representation of the K-L divergence for binary response variables.

  topic: Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    Losistic regression is perhaps one of the most widely used models for classification and a key building block in neural networks.  In this lecture we review the logistic regression model and the KL-divergence loss function.  We then introduce the gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent algorithms and discuss how these can be used to minimize the KL-divergence loss function.  Finally, we extend the logistic regression model to the multi-class classification setting through the soft-max function and briefly discuss the connection to deep learning.

  topic: HTTP requests, REST, and XPath
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    Data are available on the Internet - they can be embedded in web pages, provided after a form submission, and accessible through a REST API. We can access data from these various sources using HTTP - the HyperText Transfer Protocol. We will cover HTTP at a high level, and provide examples of how to use it to access web pages, submit forms, and crate REST requests.  Furthermore, when the data are embedded in an HTML document, we can use XPath to locate and extract it. XPath is a powerful tool developed for locating elements and content in an XML document (much better than regular expressions!). We cover the basics of XPath, which is enough to write complex expressions.

  topic: Ethics in Data Science
  lecturer: Guest Speaker <a href="https://www.jkroll.com">Joshua Kroll</a>
  description: |
    Data science is being used in growing number of settings to make decisions that impact peoples lives.  In this lecture we will discuss just a few of the many ethical and legal considerations in the application of data science to real-world problems.  

    Our guest speaker [Joshua Kroll](https://www.jkroll.com) is a computer scientist and researcher interested in the governance of automated decision-making systems, especially those built with machine learning. He is currently Postdoctoral Research Scholar at UC Berkeley's School of Information, working with Deirdre Mulligan.  Before that he received a PhD in Computer Science in the Security Group at Princeton University. His dissertation on Accountable Algorithms was advised by Edward W. Felten and supported by the Center for Information Technology Policy where he studied topics in security, privacy, and how technology informs policy decisions.  Joshua was the program chair of this year's edition of the successful workshop series ["Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT/ML)"](https://www.fatml.org). 

    We will also have short presentation from [Jake Soloff](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/jake-soloff) one of our distinguished TAs who recently won the [Citadel Data Science Competition](http://www.dailycal.org/2017/11/28/uc-berkeley-graduate-students-win-100k-international-data-science-competition/) studying the impact of charter schools on education.
