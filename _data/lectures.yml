  topic: Course Overview and The Data Science Life Cycle
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    In this lecture we provide an overview of the class, discuss what it means
    to be a data scientist by examining recent surveys of data scientists, and
    then introduce the data science lifecycle spanning question formation, data
    acquisition and cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualization, and
    finally prediction and inference.

  topic: Data Generation
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    Fundamentally, (data) science is the study of using data to learn about the
    world and solve problems.  However, how and what data is collected can have
    a profound impact on what we can learn and the problems we can solve. In
    this lecture, we will begin to explore various mechanisms for data
    collection and their implications on our ability to generalize.  In
    particular we will discuss differences between census, surveys, controlled
    experiments, and observational studies.  We will highlight the power of
    simple randomization and the fallacies of data scale.

  topic: Data Tables, Indexes, and Pandas
  lecturer: Lau
  description: |
    While data comes in many forms, most data analysis are done on tabular data.
    Mastering the skills of constructing, cleaning, joining, aggregating, and
    manipulating tabular data is essential to data science. In this lecture,
    we will introduce Pandas, the open-source Python data manipulation
    library widely used by data scientists. In addition to introducing new
    syntax, we will introduce new concepts including indexes, the role of
    column operations on system performance, and basic tools to begin
    visualizing data.

  topic: EDA and Data Cleaning
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    Whether collected by you or obtained from someone else, raw data is seldom
    ready for immediate analysis.  Through exploratory data analysis we can
    often discover important anomalies, identify limitations in the
    collection process, and better inform subsequent goal oriented analysis.
    In this lecture we will discuss how to identify and correct common data
    anomalies and their implications on future analysis.  We will also
    discuss key properties of data including structure, granularity,
    faithfulness, temporality and scope and how these properties can inform
    how we prepare, analyze, and visualize data.

  topic: Visualization and Data Tranformations 
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    A large fraction of the human brain is devoted to visual perception.   As a
    consequence, visualization is a critical tool in both exploratory data
    analysis and communicating complex relationships in data.   However, making
    informative and clear visualizations of complex concepts can be
    challenging.  In this lecture, we will explore good and bad visualizations
    and describe how to choose visualizations for various kinds of data and
    goals.

    Often directly visualizing data and relationships can result in less
    informative plots. However by combining basic data transformations and
    additional analytics we can often reveal and visualize important and
    informative patterns in data.  In this lecture we will continue to explore
    visualization and discuss several data transformations to address noise,
    heavy tail behavior, and high-dimensional data.

  topic: Working with Text
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    Whether in documents, tweets, or records in a table, text data is
    ubiquitous and presents a unique set of challenges for data scientists.
    How do you extract key phrases from text?  What are meaningful aggregate
    summaries of text?  How do you visualize textual data?  In this lecture we
    will introduce a set of techniques (e.g., bag-of-words) to transform text
    into numerical data and subsequent tabular analysis.  We will also
    introduce regular expressions as a mechanism for cleaning and transforming
    text data data.

  topic: Estimation
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    How do we pick a number to represent a dataset?  What makes a number a good representation? The statistician (and data scientist ahead of his time) George Box once wrote “Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.”  A key step in data science is developing models that capture the essential signal in data while providing insight into the phenomena that govern the data and enable prediction effective prediction.  In this lecture we address the fundamental question of how to choose a number and more generally a model that reflects the data.  In the process we develop the foundation of empirical risk minimization.

  topic: Model Estimation Continued
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    How do we characterize a model estimation procedure?  In this lecture we
    will continue our exploration of model estimation and examine how the
    estimation procedure relates to the underlying distributions.  In
    particular we will begin to explore the bias-variance trade-off.

- date: 9/26/2017
  topic: Hypothesis Testing
  lecturer: Nolan
  description: |
    A key step in inference is often answering a question about the world.  Are
    students more likely to succeed if they study?  Answering these inferential
    questions is hypothesis testing.  In this lecture we will examine a
    collection non-parametric hypothesis tests.  These powerful procedures
    build on the basic idea of random simulation to help quantify our certainty
    in a particular conclusion.  In the process of using these procedures we
    will also touch on the challenges of false discovery and multiple
    hypothesis testing.

  topic: Least Squares Linear Regression
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    Modeling the relationships between variables is a common task in data
    science and perhaps one of the most widely used models is linear
    regression.  In this lecture we introduce least squares linear regression
    through the lens of empirical risk minimization.

- date: 10/5/2017
  topic: Prediction Bias and Variance
  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    In this lecture we continue our introduction to least square linear
    regression and provide a formal analysis of the bias and variance as it
    relates to the least squares objective.

  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    SQL is the most widely used language for accessing and manipulating data.
    In this lecture we introduce the SQL language and more broadly the
    Relational Model of data.  We will describe some of the basic SQL
    operations and provide some motivation behind the relational model of
    tabular data.

  lecturer: Gonzalez
  description: |
    In this lecture we continue to dig into more advanced SQL expressions.  We
